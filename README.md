# ðŸš€ AI-Powered Task & Payment Management Platform

<img src="image/matrix.png" alt="Matrix visualization" title="Matrix Image">

## **Overview**
This platform revolutionizes task management by integrating AI-driven decision-making with onchain payments. Inspired by the Eisenhower Matrix, it categorizes tasks based on urgency and importance while incorporating financial incentives to ensure efficiency. The system enables:

- **Automated Task Prioritization**: AI classifies tasks into four categories: high-value, low-value, redistributable, and disposable.
- **Onchain Payment Redistribution**: Users receive compensation if a task is deemed unworthy of their time, while valuable tasks are delegated or monetized.
- **Smart Scheduling & Logging**: The system intelligently reschedules tasks based on priority and keeps logs for future insights.
- **Decentralized Collaboration**: Tasks can be reassigned to users who are best suited to handle them, ensuring efficiency and fairness.
- **AI-Driven Financial Optimization**: AI agents interact with DeFi protocols to optimize fund allocation for task execution.
